I studying to become a developer and I am familiar with many languages such as C#, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Java. I am also very proficient in computer hardware, and I am presently studying for my CompTIA A+ Certification, which is a  big deal to me. I also am participating in the IB program at my high school, which is a very rigorous program that is recognized worldwide. I have mostly programmed in the front end and there is still a long way to go in my programming carrier that I hope to accomplish throughout my life. I have created small apps and games mostly using C# that you can find in my Projects page. Most of them are open source via GitHub.</p>
