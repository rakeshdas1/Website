		<p id = "intro"> Throughout my programming journey, I have created many programs, and most of them can be found on my GitHub. The majority of these programs have been written in C#, a modern and easy to use language, and I have made applications with both with GUIs and command line interfaces. Also, I am venturing into the world of Android development by learning Java. Some of my favorite languages include HTML, CSS, C#, and the jQuery JavaScript library. Some of my projects are listed below with descriptions of each one.</p>

		<div class = "projects" id = "project1">
			<H1>Calculator:</H1>
			<p>A simple command line calculator that I build in Visual Studio using C#, one of the first programming languages that I learned. It helped me understand some main concepts of the C# programming. You can view the source on <a id ="git" href="https://github.com/rakeshdas1/Calculator">GitHub</a></p>

		<div class = "projects" id = "project2">
			<h1>Calculator GUI:</h1>
			<p>Very similar to the last project, but with this one, I have a built a GUI. This is one of the first GUIs I have built using Visual Studio and programming using C#. You can view the source <a id = "git"href="https://github.com/rakeshdas1/Calculator_GUI">here.</a></p>
		</div>
		<div class = "projects" id = "project3">
			<h1>Flappy Bird:</h1>
			<p>My first game that I built was a Flappy Bird clone, and this is written in JavaScript with some help from the Phaser JS engine and it could be very easily tweaked, for cheating, of course. You can find the source on <a id = "git" href="https://github.com/rakeshdas1/Calculator_GUI">GitHub.</a></p>
